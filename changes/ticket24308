  o Minor features (denial-of-service memory limiter):
    - Allow the user to configure even lower values for the MaxMemInQueues
      parameter.  Relays now enforce a minimum of 64 MB, when previously
      the minimum was 256 MB.  On clients, there is no minimum. Relays and
      clients will both warn if the value is set so low that Tor is likely
      to stop working. Closes ticket 24308.
